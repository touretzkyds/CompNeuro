           Attractor Bump Model

Copyright (c) 1999-2002 by David S. Touretzky

Follows the equations in: 
  Goodridge, J.P. and Touretzky, D. S. (2000) Modeling
  attractor deformation in the rodent head direction system.
  Journal of Neurophysiology, 83(6):3402-3410.

Instructions for use:

This software requires MATLAB version 5 or higher.

To run the model, type "run".

Mouse on one of the flanks of the bump to supply external input (the
red curve) and make the attractor bump move.  The height of the mouse
above the x-axis determines the magnitude of the external input.
Multiple mouse clicks have additive effects.

Turn on "Input Hold" to suspend decay of external input.
