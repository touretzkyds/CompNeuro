================================================================

To run the demo, type "matmem".

Click on "New" to delete all memory items and start fresh.
Click on "Random" to generate a random set of memory items.
Click on a memory item button to store the item; click again to remove it.
Click on Set to store all the memory items (sets all the buttons.)
Click on "Reset" to un-set all the buttons.
Click on "Delete" followed by a memory item button to delete that item.

Click on the "Dense"/"Sparse" button to change between representations.

You can create items of your own by typing data into the text boxes
provided; then click on an empty memory item button to copy the item
to the button and store it.

You can also click on individual input or output bits or individual
weight bits to toggle their state.  Once a pattern has been entered
into the input and output bits, the small red "S" button will store
that pattern in the weight matrix using the outer product formula.

The output bits are thresholded.  Blue indicates a value of 0; yellow
indicates a value of 1 (net activation was above threshold).  Magenta
indicates that net activation is positive but below threshold.
