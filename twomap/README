Follows the equations in: 
  Goodridge, J.P. and Touretzky, D. S. (2000) Modeling
  attractor deformation in the rodent head direction system.
  Journal of Neurophysiology, 83(6):3402-3410.

Original version created April, 1999 by David S. Touretzky.  Modified
June 2000 by David S. Touretzky and Marios Savvides to overlay two
attractor maps and allow external input to make the bump jump from one
map to the other.

================================================================

Instructions for use:

This software requires MATLAB version 5 or higher.

To run the model, type "twomap".

Mouse on one of the flanks of the bump, in either map, to supply
external input and make the attractor bump move.  The height of the
mouse above the x-axis determines the magnitude of the external input.
Multiple mouse clicks have additive effects.

Turn on "Input Hold" to suspend decay of external input.

To get the bump to switch maps, supply strong external input anywhere
in the other map.  (You may want to use Input Hold for this.)  This
will cause the bump in the current map to collapse as a new bump forms
in the second map.
